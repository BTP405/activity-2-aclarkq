# Question 5
## Part 1.
Each code snippet is being used to create a console output of a series of numbers, seperated by a comma. 

Approach 1 creates a function (`doubleL`) that takes a list of numbers as an argument. It then creates an empty list, and populates the empty list with values equal to double the values of the numbers in the original argument list, producing a list of the same length, but where all of the members are exactly 2 times that of the original. It then uses a "for" loop to print out each number in the new list, seperated by a space-bookended colon. This approach is logical, but does use memory to create a second list whose sole purpose is to be displayed on the console; an action that could be done without having to create an entirely new list.

Approach 2 simplifies the function into a lsit comprehension, `[n*2 for n in range(5)]`, and then loops through that new list to print each number, followed by a space-bookended colon. While this code is much simpler and easier to read, it still has the same pitfall that approach 1 has, causing it to use uneccessary memory.

Approach 3 follows a similar line of thinking to the first approach, creating a list of numbers before printing them, seperated with colons. However, instead of explicitly defining a list first, it creates a generator function with yield instead of returning a list. Because this generator can only iterate once over the items, it technically creates a queue (which functions the same as a list in this case).
